# Weather App

**WeatherApp** is a simple weather application that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user's location or search input. The app provides weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness. The user can either grant location access or search for a specific city.

## Features:
- **Automatic Location Detection**: Uses the browser's geolocation feature to fetch the weather based on the user's current location.
- **City Search**: Allows the user to search for weather by typing the city name.
- **Weather Details**: Displays city name, country flag, temperature, weather description, wind speed, humidity, and cloudiness.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop screens.

## Tech Stack:
- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling the application with a clean and simple design.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic features like fetching weather data and interacting with the DOM.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For fetching real-time weather data.
